# FruitsProject
 I would like to add that I didn't have a mic, so I will be putting my info here; for the project to work correctly, you must use purple grapes while having a white background with the lights on to make sure this works correctly, also I submitted my trained project on canvas just now I am working on getting GitHub fixed because it had been not working for me until I went to office hours and figured out why now I know how to submit my project correctly. THANK YOU FOR THE EXTRA TIME. I had a hard time figuring out how to submit it since I'm using jupyternotebook.
(I submitted the documentation late but that has the rest of this on it)
